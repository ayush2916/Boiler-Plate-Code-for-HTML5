# Boiler Plate Code for HTML5
 HTML5 Boilerplate is a professional front-end template for building fast, robust, and adaptable web apps or sites.

This project is the product of years of iterative development and community knowledge. It does not impose a specific development philosophy or framework, so you're free to architect your code in the way that you want.

It includes predefined features like -

jQuery with CDN

Apache Server Configs

Useful CSS helper classes

Default print styles, performance optimized and more

Depending on what you want to use and how you want to use it, you may have to copy and paste the contents of that folder into your project directory. 

Thus giving you a already pre-configured starter template to speed up your development time.
